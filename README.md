<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

The main objective of this data structure lab is to implement the Circular Queue using array. In this lab students are able to understand the concepts Circular Queue and also understand the practical implementation of Circular Queue using array.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>
Circular queue is a linear data structure. It follows FIFO (First In First Out) principle. In circular queue the last node is connected back to the first node to make a circle.  Elements are added at the rear end and the elements are deleted at front end of the queue. The queue is considered as a circular queue when the positions 0 and MAX-1 are adjacent. Any position before front is also after rear.
