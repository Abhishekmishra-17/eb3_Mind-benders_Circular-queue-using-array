#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Problem Based
###### Assessment Method: Expository and guided inquiry

<u> <b>Description: </b> The instructional strategy of this experiment is "Problem based", because student will perform the experiment and are able to find the solution of problem statement. The problem statement is in form of input array and simulator will show that the concept of Circular Queue for that particular problem. </u>

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.|  Recall the concept <br> of Circular Queue and array. | students will able to<br> perform the basic operation in simulator. | Question1: Cicular queue is a ? <br><b>A. FIFO List <br></b>B. LIFO list<br>C. Ordered Array <br> D. Linear Tree <br>Question2: What is Time complexity of deQueue operation in Cicular Queue?<br>A.O(n-1)<br><b>B.O(n)</b><br>C.O(1)<br>D. None of the above
2.| Describe  the algorithm of Circular Queue experiment. | students are able to see the working concept of algorithm<br> according to operation, which <br>has to be perform in simulator | Question1: What if (rear + 1) % Array size = front <br><b>A. Queue is full <br></b>B. Queue is empty <br>C. Both A and B <br>D. None of these <br> Question2: What if rear = front != -1<br> A.Queue is empty<br>B.Queue is full<br><b>C.Queue has only one elelment</B><br>D. None of above
3.| Experiment with the concept of array <br>in implementation of Circular Queue. | students are select the operation<br>and see the performance of that operation. | Question: What is Cicular Queue empty condition?<br>A. Rear equals to front<br><b>B. Front equals to -1</b><br> C. Front to Array Size-1 <br> D. Rear equals to Array Size-1

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.|  User is click on<br>"Run" button  |  Simulator will start and<br>it declared the global variables | To initialize the simulator and experiment.
2.|  User is provide some<br>information regarding the<br>experiment | Simulator takes the imput from<br>user and store it in initailized array |To initialize the array<br> and to make user interaction .
3.|  User will able to select the <br>basic operation,<br>which has to be perform in experiment | Simulator show the algorithm<br>pattern and show the animation part<br>of selected operation | For describe the concepts and operation involve in this experiment.
